# My C++ Archive
## A collection of some of the C++ programs I've created and worked in and outside of class.

### roulette.cpp
A C++ command line roulette game that utlizes randomized results and probability. The randomized results are produced by the `srand()` and `rand()` functions found in the `<cstdlib>` library of the C++ langauge. The `rand()` function is configured to create an integer from 0 to 36 which functions like a roulette wheel. Featuring 10 different types of bets, all of which are found in the actual physical game, the game also features common functionalities found in typical betting games including a balance counter and the option to quit the game at any point. This project allowed to me to further understand probability specifically concerning the likelyhood of outcomes of the different bets found in the game.

### curve.cpp

A small C++ program that I created as practice for my midterm exam while taking CS111. The program curves grades by calculating the difference bewtween the highest class grade and 100, and proceeding to add the difference to all scores. The user has the option to enter the student's first and last name so as to keep track of whose score is being curved.

### Rat.cpp

A class for the creation of Rational Numbers aka RATS. The class features several constructors depending on the type of RAT the user wants to build, different arithmetic operators to do various arithmetic operations on the RATS, and a simplification function to simplify the RATS once they have been either divided, multiplied, added, or subtracted. Worked on in the FALL 2021 semester while taking Dr. Jerry Waxman's CS211 "Object Oriented Programming in C++" course.
