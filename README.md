# My C++ Archive
## A collection of some of the C++ programs I've created outside of class.

### roulette.cpp
A C++ command line roulette game that utlizes randomized results and probability. The randomized results are produced by the `srand()` and `rand()` functions found in the `<cstdlib>` library of the C++ langauge. The `rand()` function is configured to create an integer from 0 to 36 which functions like a roulette wheel. Featuring 10 different types of bets, all of which are found in the actual physical game, the game also features common functionalities found in typical betting games including a balance counter and the option to quit the game at any point. This project allowed to me to further understand probability specifically concerning the likelyhood of outcomes of the different bets found in the game.

### curve.cpp

A small C++ program that curves grades by calculating the difference bewtween the highest class grade and 100, and proceeding to add the difference to all scores. The user has the option to enter the student's first and last name so as to keep track of whose score is being curved.
