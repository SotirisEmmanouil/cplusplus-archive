# My C++ Archive
## A collection of some of the C++ programs I've created and worked on, in and outside of class.

### Rat.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108318635/190484524-bab9c025-402e-4cf2-ad4c-23022ca4ac88.png)


A class for the creation of Rational Numbers aka RATS. The class features several constructors depending on the type of RAT the user wants to build, different arithmetic operators to do various arithmetic operations on the RATS, and a simplification function to simplify the RATS once they have been either divided, multiplied, added, or subtracted. Worked on in the FALL 2021 semester while taking Dr. Jerry Waxman's CS211 "Object Oriented Programming in C++" course.

### roulette.cpp
A C++ command line roulette game that utlizes randomized results and probability. The randomized results are produced by the `srand()` and `rand()` functions found in the `<cstdlib>` library of the C++ langauge. The `rand()` function is configured to create an integer from 0 to 36 which functions like a roulette wheel. Featuring 10 different types of bets, all of which are found in the actual physical game, the game also features common functionalities found in typical betting games including a balance counter and the option to quit the game at any point. This project allowed to me to further understand probability specifically concerning the likelyhood of outcomes of the different bets found in the game.

### towersofhanoi.cpp

Towers of Hanoi puzzle solver using vector data structure implementation. Works for both even and odd number of rings. Created while taking CS211 
"Object Oriented Programming in C++" with Dr.Jerry Waxman in the Fall 2021 semester. 


### 8Queens2DArray.cpp 

A solution to the 8 of Queens problem using a 2D array to mimic a chess Board and goto statements to implement backtracking, 
and iteration through the rows and columns. This program was created while taking CS211 "Object Oriented Programming in C++" with  Dr.Jerry Waxman in the Fall 2021 semester.

### curve.cpp

A small C++ program that I created as practice for my midterm exam while taking CS111. The program curves grades by calculating the difference bewtween the highest class grade and 100, and proceeding to add the difference to all scores. The user has the option to enter the student's first and last name so as to keep track of whose score is being curved.

### quiz1.cpp

A small C++ program I created while taking Professor Gerald Landau's CS211 lab section. This program was assigned as a quick quiz. The program receives the student's name, four test grades, stores them in an array, calculates the average of the stored array entries, and prints the average along with the students name.
